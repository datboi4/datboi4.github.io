    <h1>Compound Commands in Bash</h1>
    <p>
      In this module I will go over Compound Commands and the types of Compound Commands there are. A Compound Command is a way in bash to group simple commands together. The first type is a subshell which is a temporary shell so when it terminates all the commands are gone. The second type is command grouping which uses curley braces to group together commands and will be considered one.
