    <h1>Commands and Arguments</h1>
    <p>
      In this module I learned about commands and arguments. A command is an instruction for the computer to carry out. All input is treated as a command. Some examples of commands are the ls command which lists everything in your current directory, the touch command which will either changes the last modified date or creates a file with that name. Strings are type of commandes that will treat a series of characters as one command. One example of this type of command is cat which will list whats in a file. Arguments is a parameter after the command, one command that uses an arguments is echo which prints the argument in the terminal.
