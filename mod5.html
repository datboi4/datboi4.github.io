    <h1>Tests and Conditionals</h1>
    <p>
    In this module I will talk about Tests and Conditionals. First off a test in bash is a test determines wheter something is true or false, and a Conditional decides wheter to keep runnig the script. One Example of a test is Exit status. Every time you run a command when it is terminated a exit code is generated which is a number from 0 to 255. The number 0 means it was succsessful and any number meaned it failed. One way we can genrate an exit code is the ping command which will send packets over a network to a host. Since there are no host with packets we will always get an error code greater than 0.
