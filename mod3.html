     <h1>Patterns in bash</h1>
    <p>
    In this module I will go over Patterns. Patterns in bash have two main purposes one is selecting a filename in a directory the other one is determining if a sting follow a desired format or not. One type of pattern is a glob pattern which that are used to find filenames. These type of patterns ues metacharacters like * which can replace an entire string and ? which replaces a single character.Regular expressions are very similar to Glob Patterns but find patterns not filenames.
